## 💡 Tips for Success:

### **If You Get Stuck:**
1. ✅ Re-read the working example above your challenge
2. ✅ Compare your code character-by-character
3. ✅ Check for syntax errors (missing ; or })
4. ✅ Look at console for error messages (red text)
5. ✅ Take a 10-minute break and come back

### **Speed Up Learning:**
- 🎯 Don't skip tasks - they build on each other
- 🎯 Play with the interactive demos first
- 🎯 Type code yourself, don't just read
- 🎯 Experiment - try changing values and see what happens
- 🎯 Check the console ALWAYS - half the learning is there

### **Stay Motivated:**
- 🏆 Each task = one skill unlocked
- 🏆 By task 5, you'll feel like a programmer
- 🏆 By task 10, you'll HAVE a working game
- 🏆 Share your progress with friends

---

## 🚨 Common Beginner Mistakes to Avoid:

❌ **Skipping the demos** - Always click buttons first!
❌ **Not opening console** - You'll miss important info
❌ **Copy-pasting without reading** - Understand WHY, not just HOW
❌ **Rushing** - Take your time, experiment, have fun
❌ **Not saving files** - Save (Ctrl+S) before refreshing browser
❌ **Giving up after 1 error** - Errors are normal! Debug them!
